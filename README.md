# Stock-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a primary company and constructing two portfolios using Python and the yfinance library for financial data retrieval. The key tasks involved are:

## Market Analysis:

### Historical Price Movement:
- Fetch daily price data for the primary company over the last 5 years.
- Generate price charts (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Identify lifetime highs/lows and 52-week highs/lows.
- Calculate risk measures (standard deviation, beta) and return measures (daily, monthly, annual returns).
- Analyze technical indicators like Moving Averages (20-day, 50-day), RSI (14-day), and MACD (12-day, 26-day, 9-day signal).
### Ratio Analysis:
- Compute key financial ratios: Valuation (P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA), Profitability (ROE, ROA), and growth metrics (Revenue growth, EPS growth).
- Compare stock price performance with financial performance and explain deviations.

## Portfolio Analysis:

### Portfolio Construction: [To be done]
- Build a portfolio of 5 stocks: 30% in the primary company and price-weighted for the others.
- Calculate performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Jensenâ€™s Alpha) and compare against a benchmark index.
### Diversification Benefits:
- Analyze the risk-reward pattern of the primary stock versus the portfolio.
- Build a correlation-based portfolio and compare its performance with the price-weighted portfolio.
